# RankSentinel

RankSentinel detect players using lower ranked abilities and notifies them. Inspired by the legacy add-on [RankWatch](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/rankwatch).

RankSentinel is a [spiritual successor to the now defunct GogoWatch](https://github.com/valkyrnstudios/RankSentinel/issues/5) and SpellSnob add-ons.

Legitimate Low-rank Abilities have been excluded; including All Heals, Rank 1 Frost Bolt, Rank 1 Earth Shock, Rank 1 Blizzard, etc.
